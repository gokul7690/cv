  <h3>Projects</h3>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Data Migration from Sql to Mql Database</strong> Had to migrate a few million data from Sql to Mql (Matrix Query Language) Database. Had
        to write a java code in order to fetch 3 separate date (viz History, Specifications and Formula Attachments) and also to generate Mql
        scripts. The Mql scripts were responsible for the data load into the Mql Database.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Dynamic Import Template</strong> Had to create a few workflows based on the input from an excel sheet. Had to write servlets order to build
        the ExcelUtils and also to fetch the data and populate it according in the front end. No matter what fields are being added in the excel
        sheet, it will dynamically get uploaded into the database. Handling the multi select values were quite challenging.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Performance Enhancement Task</strong> There was a scenario when the amount of data exceeded a certain limit, the home page of the
        company‚Äôs website was at stake. It took 45 seconds for the site to load. Around 80,000 documents were fetched altogether from a left
        join that involved 3 tables of size 50,000 each. Proved the 45 second delay in theory and found out the problems in indexing. Still working
        on indexing the database. But I will be trying a newer approach as well through Paginating the data! (fetching the prompted records in
        real time)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>History Tracker for a Formula and its composition</strong> This involves tracking the history of two separate tables which had only one field
        in common to each other. Creating a separate table for tracking the history wasn‚Äôt a problem but the challenge was to write a trigger
        whenever either table changes, we have to track their history with the respective version numbers. Since there are no sufficient number
        of common fields between the two, the trigger was written in such a way that counts the number of versions in each table and copies the
        respective history by incrementing its revision. This may seem to be a tricky way to track a history but there was no other solution found
        in order to maintain the reliability with the version numbers. The UI part was a little bit tricky as well which involved a side by side
        comparison of the version based history.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Download Attributes History into an Excel</strong> This involved writing some ExcelUtils and also writing a separate view in order to populate
        the necessary history information based on the requirements specification document. This involved populating data from 4 different tables
        into two different tabs (restricting the data based on the constraints built on the header information)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Blog Management System</strong> This is a web app built in order to manage blogs. We had to deal with three different users. The blogger who
        creates, edits, deletes the blog. The reader who searches for various blogs using keywords/hashtags can also add those blogs to his/her
        favorites and also can comment/report on the blog. The admin who can view the list of users/blogs and can delete the reported users/blogs
        from the system. The entire webapp was written in Sprint Boot.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>NBA OnTheGo</strong> This is a web app build in Spring Boot. We also had to request for the non-commercial api access key from
        mysportsfeed.com in order to update the users with most recent and upto date information regarding the fixtures, results, team stats,
        player stats and also give the users freedom to pick their favorite teams and view their stats upon a single click on their home page. The
        main challenge was the web service integration since we didn‚Äôt have much of the hands-on experience with the RESTful API web services.
        The project involved two users 1. The admin who can view the users and remove/block them based on the reports 2. The customer
        audience who are interested/follow the NBA league.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Download ProductTracker with Metrics </strong> One of the projects involved downloading the data from a product tracker dashboard and
        populate the available data into an excel of any given format. The challenge was to populate the data according to the specified metrics.
        The report should be reliable in such a way that the data can be retrieved and a report is created based on a Quarterly basis, or a product
        with similar regulatory restrictions and so on. The main difficulty was to fetch various nodes along with their respective earliest due dates.</td>
